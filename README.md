### Malware Detection &amp; Privacy Leaks in Android apps using Static Analysis

To preserve privacy of users, a permission induced risk interface MalApp Classification to identify privacy violations rising from granting permissions during app installation is proposed. It comprises of multi-fold process that performs static analysis of apps based on appâ€™s category.

First, concept of reverse engineering is applied to extract app permissions to construct a Boolean-valued permission matrix. /\
Second, ranking of permissions is done to identify the risky permissions across category. Heuristic approach is incorporated which assigns a greater heuristic value to a riskier permission. \
Third, machine learning and ensembling techniques have been incorporated to test the efficacy of the proposed approach on a data set of 404 benign and 409 malicious apps.

The interface has been successfully implemented using Java and Python which makes it compatible on all Operating Systems.

## How To run
Compile and run MyInterface.java \
Browse and select the test apk and its category for the classification
